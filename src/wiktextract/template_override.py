# To use parameters with reg() for the template-name stuff,
# we need to have three (four) levels of functions here.
# We do not technically have a wrapper function because
# we just return func as is. middle() is not a wrapper function,
# it's the actual decorator function itself (called with func)
# and reg() is actually a kind of wrapper around the decorator
# function that takes a parameter that middle() can't take.
# A bit messy conceptually.
